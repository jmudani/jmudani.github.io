            <li class="sublist"><strong>ITSC3146 - Intro Oper Syst & Networking:</strong> At first it was because I had to but honestly it is a pretty interesting course so far, using the terminal to do with the computer has made me want to learn more.</li>

            <li class="sublist"><strong>ITIS3135 - Web App Design and Development:</strong> I have always wanted to understand html and how to make websites, as I mentioned before my parents own a small retail business and I always thought it would be cool to design a website for their store and try to expand there business online and so I am pretty excited for this course.</li>
            <li class="sublist"><strong>MATH2164 - Matrices and Linear Algebra:</strong> Only because I have to, I don’t hate math but I really don’t like the stress of math tests with all the college work I already have and I really didn’t want to take this course but it's fine.</li>

        <li class="mainlist"><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> I was the first person to be born in the U.S.A in my family.</li>
