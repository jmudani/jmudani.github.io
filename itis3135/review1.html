        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Contrast: Suprisingly good, personally don't like the color scheme because I believe a technical page should be less colorful and I feel like too much is happening but everything is easy to read and it seems to work.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Hard to judge as this website helps you make a website so its constantly changing but the buttons and the instructions seem to keep consistency throughout.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Well done, everything seems to be aligned to the left for most of the site and works well.</li>
            <li>Proximity: I think that everything is more towards the left and the center is very open, I'm sure that could change as someone makes there website but as of now seems empty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall site looks very good, I think in the future the color format could definetly get another look at and the space could be better used but regardless of those minor suggestions, job well done!</p>
