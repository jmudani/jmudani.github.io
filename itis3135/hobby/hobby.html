                <p class="hobbyInfo">Hello, my name is Jai Mudani. I am a junior at UNC Charlotte and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.</p>
                
                <br>

                <p class="hobbyInfo">I have played basketball since I was very little, my dad bought me a basketball hoop that we put up on our driveway and it has been my favorite hobby ever since. 
                    To me its not just a sport, its an art, and not just for me but to millions of people as well. I tried taking sort of a basketball training camp and playing for a team because everyone always said I would be good at it since I was always tall for my age
                    but it never worked out and I just sort of left it as a hobby. I keep up with the NBA (National Basketball League) regularly and I try to go to some of my colleges (UNC charlotte) games but as you can see below, we could use some more support!

                    Basketball seasons typically follow a structured format, with professional leagues, college conferences, and high school associations all having their own variations. In the professional realm, such as the NBA (National Basketball Association) in the United States, a typical basketball season spans several months, usually starting in October and running through April. The season is divided into two main parts: the regular season and the playoffs.
                </p>
                <p class="hobbyInfo">
                    During the regular season, teams play a predetermined number of games against other teams in the league. The schedule is organized to ensure that each team faces a diverse range of opponents, both home and away. Teams earn points based on their performance, with wins contributing to their standings in the league. The regular season is crucial for determining which teams will advance to the playoffs, with the top-performing teams securing a spot in the postseason.
                </p>
                <p class="hobbyInfo">
                    The playoffs are a knockout-style tournament where teams compete in a series of elimination rounds to determine the ultimate champion. The format usually involves a best-of-seven series in each round, with the winners advancing to the next stage until the two conference champions face off in the championship series (such as the NBA Finals). The team that secures the required number of victories in the championship series is crowned the overall winner of the season. This structured format adds excitement and intensity to the basketball season with back-to-back elimination games that end with the current best teams fighting to be called the best.

                    Basketball is played in a variety of settings, ranging from professional arenas to local community courts. At the professional level, major leagues like the NBA in the United States, the EuroLeague in Europe, and various other national leagues worldwide utilize state-of-the-art indoor arenas. These venues are equipped with high-capacity seating, advanced lighting, and broadcasting facilities to accommodate large audiences both in person and through televised broadcasts. Iconic arenas, such as Madison Square Garden in New York City or the Staples Center in Los Angeles, serve as hallowed grounds for basketball enthusiasts and host numerous games throughout a season.

                    On the collegiate level, basketball is played in university arenas and campus gyms. College basketball enjoys widespread popularity, especially during events like March Madness in the United States, where games take place in various locations across the country. High school basketball is typically played in school gyms, and community centers also play a crucial role in providing spaces for local basketball leagues, pickup games, and youth development programs.

                    Beyond formalized leagues and competitions, public outdoor courts are widespread and form an integral part of the street basketball culture. Parks, playgrounds, and open spaces in urban and suburban areas often feature basketball hoops, allowing individuals to engage in casual games, hone their skills, and foster a sense of community. The versatility of basketball courts in terms of location and accessibility contributes to the sport's global appeal, making it a common sight in neighborhoods, schools, and public spaces around the world.

                    Basketball is a fast-paced sport played between two teams, each consisting of five players. The objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's basket, which is mounted 10 feet above the floor. The game begins with a jump ball at center court, where the referee tosses the ball into the air, and players from each team try to gain possession. The team with the ball is on offense, while the other team is on defense, aiming to prevent the offensive team from scoring.
                </p>
                <p class="hobbyInfo">
                    To score, players must shoot the ball into the opponent's basket. A field goal made from outside the three-point arc earns three points, while shots made inside the arc count for two points. Free throws, awarded after certain fouls, are worth one point each. The game is played in quarters, with professional leagues typically having four quarters lasting 12 minutes each.
                </p>
                <p class="hobbyInfo">
                    Basketball involves constant movement, passing, and strategic plays. Players can dribble the ball (bounce it on the floor) while moving, but they are not allowed to run holding the ball without dribbling. The defensive team aims to block shots, steal the ball, or force turnovers to regain possession. Physical contact is regulated by the rules, and fouls are called for illegal physical conduct, resulting in free throws or possession for the opposing team.
                </p>
                <p class="hobbyInfo">
                    The shot clock is a critical element in basketball, dictating the maximum time a team has to attempt a shot. If a team fails to make a shot within the allotted time, the opposing team gains possession. The team with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner. The fast-paced nature, skillful maneuvers, and teamwork required make basketball an exciting and widely celebrated sport globally.
