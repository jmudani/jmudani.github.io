        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Contrast: In terms of contrast, I think the site does really well with such a nice color mix of snowy white color mixed with grey font. I think that when I think of nails and salons I think of more colorful things and believe the site could use some.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Maintains a consistent layout and design throughout the website, think there could be some variety because the site feels too formal to me but if thats what the goal was then it is good.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Alignment could use some work, in the "gallery" and "about" tab the image is all the way to the left while info is in the middle, throwing off the alignment of the site.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Good use of spacing for the most part, in the services tab I believe that the information is very closely squeezed in the middle and could be spread out more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall did a good job with the website, there are some specific minor things that should be easy to fix and some suggestions that can be implemented but other than that well done!</p>
