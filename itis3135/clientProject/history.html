                Basketball, a dynamic and fast-paced sport, has a rich history that dates back to the late 19th century. Its invention is credited to Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor, who introduced the game in December 1891. Seeking an indoor activity to keep his students active during the winter months, Naismith devised a set of 13 basic rules and hung a peach basket at each end of the gymnasium as goals. The objective was simple: throw a soccer ball into the opposing team's basket to score points. This laid the foundation for what would become one of the world's most popular sports.

                As basketball gained popularity, the sport's growth was fueled by various factors, including its adaptability to different environments, minimal equipment requirements, and the ease with which it could be played in both urban and rural settings. The first official game was played at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts, and soon after, colleges and universities embraced the sport. The first professional basketball league, the National Basketball League (NBL), was formed in 1898, but it lasted only six years. The sport continued to evolve, and in 1936, basketball made its Olympic debut at the Berlin Games.
